# React Portfolio
## Description
This project uses React to build a personal portfolio. There are four sections that render conditionally: a short about me section, a portfolio section that includes links to projects, a section with contact information, and a resume section. I enjoyed getting to practice using React and felt very satisfied when I was able to make the navbar work. 

## Usage
You can visit the deployed webpage here: https://incandescent-bombolone-0bd890.netlify.app/#portfolio. The page always loads on the 'about me' section. Switch between pages by clicking on the tabs in the navbar. The portfolio page has links to the projects. Click on the image or the title to visit the deployed webpage, and click on the Github line to visit the repository for each project.

## Credits
This project used examples from the activities in module 20 to structure the folders and files.

The Bulma card template was adapted from the example in the Bulma docs.

The color variables were found on coolers.com, available here: https://coolors.co/user/palettes/64ee4d4d061019000bfbf21e
